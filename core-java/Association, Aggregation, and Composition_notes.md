# Understanding Association, Aggregation, and Composition in OOP
  
A deep dive into the relationships between classes in Object-Oriented Programming, including how **association**, **aggregation**, and **composition** differ in structure and behavior.

This document serves as a quick reference guide for Java developers and OOP learners.

## What is Association in OOP?

**Association** is a **general relationship** between two classes, where one object uses or refers to another.

### 🔑 Key Features
- Represents a **"uses-a"** or **"has-a"** relationship.
- Objects can be related **without ownership**.
- May be **unidirectional** or **bidirectional**.

### 📌 Example

```java
class Student {
    private String name;
    // ...
}

class School {
    private List<Student> students;
}
```

> In this example, `School` has an **association** with `Student`.

**Association types:**
- One-to-One
- One-to-Many
- Many-to-One
- Many-to-Many

## What is Aggregation in OOP?

**Aggregation** is a **special form of association** where one class contains a reference to another class, but without ownership.

### 🔑 Key Features
- Represents a **"has-a"** relationship.
- **Weak** association – the child can exist **independently**.
- Implemented via object reference.
- Represented by a **hollow diamond** in UML diagrams.

### 📌 Example

```java
class Professor {
    private String name;
}

class Department {
    private List<Professor> professors;

    Department(List<Professor> professors) {
        this.professors = professors;
    }
}
```

> `Professor` exists independently of `Department`.

 ## What is Composition in OOP?

**Composition** is a **strong form of aggregation**, where one class owns another class and is responsible for its lifecycle.

### 🔑 Key Features
- Represents a **"part-of"** or **strong has-a** relationship.
- **Strong** association – the child cannot exist **without** the parent.
- Represented by a **solid diamond** in UML diagrams.

### 📌 Example

```java
class Room {
    private String type;
}

class House {
    private List<Room> rooms;

    House() {
        this.rooms = new ArrayList<>();
        rooms.add(new Room());
    }
}
```

> If `House` is destroyed, its `Room` objects also cease to exist.

## Differences between Association, Aggregation, and Composition

Here’s a comparison table highlighting the key differences:

| Feature                  | Association                      | Aggregation                      | Composition                          |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Type**                 | General relationship             | Weak "has-a"                     | Strong "has-a"                       |
| **Dependency**           | No dependency                    | Child can exist independently    | Child **cannot** exist independently |
| **Lifecycle**            | Independent                      | Independent                      | Dependent                            |
| **UML Notation**         | Plain Line                       | Hollow diamond                   | Solid diamond                        |
| **Example**              | Student ↔ School                 | Department → Professor           | House → Room                         |
